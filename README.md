## ES6_codingChallenge

This coding challenge is a part of  **[The Complete JavaScript Course: Build a Real-World Project](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/v4/overview)** on **[Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/)**.

The main **purpose** of this simple coding **challenge** is to use the new features of **ES6 / ES2015** like:

- classes
- subclasses
- template strings
- default parameters
- maps
- arrow functions
- destructuring
- and more

###Instruction of the challenge:

Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements:<br>
1. Parks<br>
2. Streets

It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and a
build year.

At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:<br>
1. Tree density of each park in the town (formula: number of trees/park area)<br>
2. Average age of each town's park (formula: sum of all ages/number of parks)<br>
3. The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees<br>
4. Total and average length of the town's streets<br>
5. Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is unknown, the default is normal

All the report data should be printed to the console.

###Note:
In the **script.js** file, you will see my solution and the solution of the instructor (commented at the end of the file).

        <h1>Coding challenge</h1>
            <p>Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements:</p>
            <p>1. Parks<p>
            <p>2. Streets</p><br>
            <p>It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and a build year.<p><br>
            <p>At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:<p>
            <p>1. Tree density of each park in the town (forumla: number of trees/park area)<p>
            <p>2. Average age of each town's park (forumla: sum of all ages/number of parks)<p>
            <p>3. The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees<p>
            <p>4. Total and average length of the town's streets<p>
            <p>5. Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is unknown, the default is normal<p><br>
            <p>All the report data should be printed to the console.</p>
